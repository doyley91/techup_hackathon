Context: To complete the fund there is one more security needed. The fund covers AI-related and ESG friendly securities. There is a final selection of three securities that the AI powered research assistant will support in making the decision regarding which security will be the last one to be included in the fund.

Important metrics that determine the suitability to include securities in the emerging market fund:
- AI profitability, potential for revenue growth
- ESG credentials, does the security meet the defined ESG requirements of the fund



Exclusion Criteria and Thresholds
Vontobel's funds, including mtx funds, use a set of exclusion criteria based on revenue thresholds for specific business activities. The Vontobel Fund II - mtx Emerging Markets Sustainability Champions (EMSC) fund has even stricter exclusions, including additional criteria for fossil fuels.

Controversial Weapons: 0% revenue from production. This includes anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, chemical, and biological weapons.

Nuclear Weapons: 0% revenue from production.

Conventional Weapons & Firearms: 0% revenue from production. The military contracting sector has a 10% revenue threshold.

Tobacco: 0% revenue from production and 10% from retail. For next-generation products like vaping, a 5% revenue tolerance applies.

Coal (extraction and power): 10% revenue threshold for production.

Oil Sands: 10% revenue threshold for production.

Nuclear Power: 10% revenue threshold for production.

Palm Oil: 0% revenue from production and distribution.

Adult Entertainment: 10% revenue threshold for production and distribution.

UN Global Compact and Global Norms Violation: Companies with confirmed violations of international norms, such as those related to forced or child labor, are excluded.

Minimum Standards Framework (MSF) and Scoring
The core of the screening process is the proprietary Minimum Standards Framework (MSF), which assesses companies on material ESG issues.

Minimum Score: To be eligible for investment, a company must achieve an overall minimum score in its MSF assessment. The passing score is 2.4 for most funds and 2.0 for the Vontobel Fund II - mtx China A Share Leaders fund.

Scoring System: The MSF uses a 1-5 scoring system. A score of 3 meets expectations and has no material risks, while a score of 2 signals underperformance and financial risk. A score of 1 indicates notable risks. A "fail score" can be applied on any single topic, regardless of the overall score.

F-Score: An over-riding "F-Score" can be given for severe ESG controversies that pose a material risk or a highly negative impact on society or the environment. Companies with a critical F-Score must be divested within three months.

Sustainability and Climate Metrics
For certain funds, such as those classified as SFDR Article 8, specific climate-related metrics are used.

Carbon Footprint: The fund's carbon footprint must be at least 20% lower than its reference benchmark. To qualify as a "Sustainable Investment," a company's carbon footprint must be in the top 30% of its benchmark.

Do No Significant Harm (DNSH): A two-step process is used to assess if a company's activities cause significant harm. For example, a company is flagged for significant harm related to biodiversity if it has severe controversies or derives more than 5% of its revenues from activities like palm oil, soy, or cattle.
